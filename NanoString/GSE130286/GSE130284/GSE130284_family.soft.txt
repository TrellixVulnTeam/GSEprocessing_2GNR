!Series_summary = An emerging cellular immunotherapy for cancer is based on the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells against a wide range of tumors. Although in vitro activation or ‘priming’ of NK cells by exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2 has been extensively studied, the biological consequences of NK cell activation in response to target cell interactions are less characterized. Herein, we investigate the consequences of co-incubation with K562, CTV-1, Daudi and RPMI-8226 tumor cell lines on the phenotype, cytokine expression profile and transcriptome of human NK cells. We observe the downregulation of several activation receptors including CD16, CD62L, C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR)-4, natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D), DNAX accessory molecule (DNAM)-1 and NKp46 following tumor-priming. Although this NK cell phenotype is typically associated with NK cell dysfunction in cancer, we show upregulation of NK cell activation markers such as CD69 and CD25, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-1) α /β and IL-1β/6/8 and overexpression of numerous genes associated with enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory functions such as FAS, TNFSF10, MAPK11, TNF and IFNG. Key signaling molecules exclusively affected by tumor-priming include MAP2K3, MARCKSL1, STAT5A, and TNFAIP3, which are specifically associated with NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor targets. Collectively, these findings help define the phenotypic and transcriptional signature of NK cells following their encounter with tumor cells, independent of cytokine stimulation, and provide insight into tumor-specific NK cell responses to inform the transition towards harnessing the therapeutic potential of NK cells in cancer.  
!Series_overall_design = The mRNA profiles of freshly isolated healthy donor-derived human NK cells after stimulation with tumor cells (K562 or CTV-1 also referred to as INB16) or cytokine (IL-2)  were analyzed through RNA-sequencing and compared to unstimulated controls (NK alone)

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For Library preparation, 100ng of total RNA was processed using the KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit (p/n KK8580) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, mRNA was isolated from total RNA using Oligo dT beads to pull down poly-adenylated transcripts. The purified mRNA was fragmented using chemical hydrolysis (heat and divalent metal cation) and primed with random hexamers. Strand-specific, first strand cDNA was generated using Reverse Transcriptase in the presence of Actinomycin D. This allows for RNA-dependent synthesis while preventing spurious DNA-dependent synthesis. The second cDNA strand was synthesized using dUTP in place of dTTP in order to mark the second strand. The resultant cDNA is then “A-tailed” at the 3’ end to prevent self-ligation and adapter dimerization. Full-length xGen adaptors (IDT) containing two unique 8bp sample-specific indexes, a unique molecular identifier (N8) and a T overhang are ligated to the A-Tailed cDNA. Successfully ligated cDNA molecules were then enriched with limited cycle PCR (14 cycles – the actual number is dependent on the amount of input RNA). The high fidelity polymerase employed in the PCR is unable to extend through uracil. This means only the first strand cDNA is amplified for sequencing, making the library strand specific (first-strand). For Sequencing, libraries to be multiplexed in the same run are pooled in equimolar quantities, calculated from Qubit and Bioanalyser fragment analysis.

Strand-specific, first strand cDNA was generated using Reverse Transcriptase in the presence of Actinomycin D. This allows for RNA-dependent synthesis while preventing spurious DNA-dependent synthesis. The second cDNA strand was synthesized using dUTP in place of dTTP in order to mark the second strand. The resultant cDNA is then “A-tailed” at the 3’ end to prevent self-ligation and adapter dimerization. Full-length xGen adaptors (IDT) containing two unique 8bp sample-specific indexes, a unique molecular identifier (N8) and a T overhang are ligated to the A-Tailed cDNA. Successfully ligated cDNA molecules were then enriched with limited cycle PCR (14 cycles – the actual number is dependent on the amount of input RNA). The high fidelity polymerase employed in the PCR is unable to extend through uracil. This means only the first strand cDNA is amplified for sequencing, making the library strand specific (first-strand). For Sequencing, libraries to be multiplexed in the same run are pooled in equimolar quantities, calculated from Qubit and Bioanalyser fragment analysis. Samples were sequenced on the NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina) using a 75bp single read run with a corresponding 8bp UMI read

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = NK cell stimulation was achieved by co-incubating  NK cells (1x10^6) with K562 or CTV-1 cells (2x10^6), or the exogenous cytokine IL-2 (200IU/ml) for 16 hours at 37ºC, 5% v/v CO2 in CM.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = NK cells were isolated from healthy donor PBMCs by negative selection (NK cell enrichment kit; StemCell Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Freshly isolated NK cells were maintained in complete medium (CM) (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 2mM L-glutamine; all from Life Technologies). The leukemic cell lines K562 and CTV-1 were maintained in CM.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = polyA RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = positive selection for CD56. RNA was extracted from the samples using the RNAqueousTM Micro Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −80°C pending analysis
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For Library preparation, 100ng of total RNA was processed using the KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit (p/n KK8580) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, mRNA was isolated from total RNA using Oligo dT beads to pull down poly-adenylated transcripts. The purified mRNA was fragmented using chemical hydrolysis (heat and divalent metal cation) and primed with random hexamers. Strand-specific, first strand cDNA was generated using Reverse Transcriptase in the presence of Actinomycin D. This allows for RNA-dependent synthesis while preventing spurious DNA-dependent synthesis. The second cDNA strand was synthesized using dUTP in place of dTTP in order to mark the second strand. The resultant cDNA is then “A-tailed” at the 3’ end to prevent self-ligation and adapter dimerization. Full-length xGen adaptors (IDT) containing two unique 8bp sample-specific indexes, a unique molecular identifier (N8) and a T overhang are ligated to the A-Tailed cDNA. Successfully ligated cDNA molecules were then enriched with limited cycle PCR (14 cycles – the actual number is dependent on the amount of input RNA). The high fidelity polymerase employed in the PCR is unable to extend through uracil. This means only the first strand cDNA is amplified for sequencing, making the library strand specific (first-strand). For Sequencing, libraries to be multiplexed in the same run are pooled in equimolar quantities, calculated from Qubit and Bioanalyser fragment analysis. Samples were sequenced on the NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina) using a 75bp single read run with a corresponding 8bp UMI read
